cuyama$long[which(cuyama$site==1)][1] #temperature increases with increased longitude - as you move towards the coast.

#Conclusion: site has an effect on temperature but it is not statistically significant once outliers are removed.

#Look at the other predictors, even though they were all not statistically significant:

boxplot(tempdatanoout$MeanMeasure~tempdatanoout$microsite) #very similar temps between microsites, more variation in shrub microsite than open
boxplot(tempdatanoout$MeanMeasure~tempdatanoout$treatment) #temperatures higher for unclipped shrubs but again lots of variation so not statistically significant
plot(tempdatanoout$MeanMeasure~tempdatanoout$Volume) #bit of a trend of decreasing temperatures with increasing shrub volume, but too much variation/too small sample size to say for sure.

##OVERALL CONCLUSION: Temperature increases with site (increases with latitude and with decreasing longitude), decreases with increased volume, and is higher for unclipped shrubs.However, none of these trends are statistically significant when our outlier is removed (tempdatanooutfit1). When the outlier from site 6 is included in the model, the only statistically significant predictor of mean temperature is a main effect of site (tempfit1 and tempfit2).

#without outlier
boxplot(moistdatanoout$MeanMeasure~moistdatanoout$treatment) #unclipped has slightly lower soil moisture than clipped. Effect of predictor looks small.
boxplot(moistdatanoout$MeanMeasure~moistdatanoout$site) #site 5 has a lot of variation in soil moisture. Site 1 has highest median soil moisture. Effect of predictor looks small.
boxplot(moistdatanoout$MeanMeasure~moistdatanoout$microsite) #shrub has slightly lower soil moisture than open microsite. Effect of predictor looks small.
plot(moistdatanoout$MeanMeasure~moistdatanoout$Volume) #Effect of predictor looks small. Pretty constant soil moisture across shrub volumes.

##OVERALL CONCLUSION: When we do not remove possible outliers, all predictors and their interactions have a statistically significant effect on soil moisture and our model explains a lot of the variation in soil moisture content (high r^2). Once these possible outliers are removed, none of our predictors or their interactions have a statistically significant effect on soil moisture content. This latter result makes sense when we look at some basic plots of the data - some trends can be seen but the effects of predictors are overall small.

#Check assumptions
#reference: https://data.library.virginia.edu/diagnostic-plots/

#Temperature model
plot(tempfit2) #with outlier - given small sample size, linearity appears okay (residuals vs. fitted), normality is okay but sample size is small so tough to tell how accurate this is (Normal Q-Q), homoscedasticity may not be well fit (scale-location), outliers actually don't appear bad (Cook's distance)
plot(tempdatanooutfit1) #without outlier - given small sample size, linearity appears okay but have high variance in some residuals (residuals vs. fitted), normality is okay but sample size is very small so tough to tell how accurate this is (Normal Q-Q), homoscedasticity may not be well fit (scale-location), still appear to have outliers (Cook's distance)

##based on assumptions check, fit with outlier might not be that bad after all!

#With the Shapiro-Wilkes test, our null hypothesis is that the residuals from our model are normally distributed - tempfit2 passes check (fail to reject null) but fit without outliers fails check (tempdatanooutfit1)
shapiro.test(residuals(tempfit2))
shapiro.test(residuals(tempdatanooutfit1))

#Moisture model
plot(moistfit1) #original model - hard to tell linearity due to outlier but appears okay (residuals vs. fitted), fit to normality is okay but not great (Normal Q-Q), homoscedasiticty assumption does not seem to be met (scale-location), appear to have outliers present (residuals vs. leverage)
plot(moistfit3) #without outlier - linearity seems okay but some variation in residuals in the middle, fit to normality is again okay but not great (Normal Q-Q), homoscedasiticty assumption seems to be met but again some points with higher variation in residuals around the middle, still appear to have a couple of outliers present (residuals vs. leverage)

shapiro.test(residuals(moistfit1)) 
shapiro.test(residuals(moistfit3))
#both models fail Shapiro-Wilkes test - suggests models do not fit assumption of normality.

##based on assumptions check, our model without the outliers is more appropriate, but still does not meet all assumptions for a linear model.

##An interesting next step for future analyses could be to run a generalized linear model with the data and see if results are similar/if fit to assumptions are improved.

##Summary: Use our model with the data point for site 3 unless removing this point drastically improves our model's fit to assumptions.

#Basic Visualizations:

boxplot(moistonlydata$Volume~moistonlydata$site) #Generally, shrub volume decreases as site increases - thus, shrub volume decreases as latitude increases and longitude decreases
boxplot(moistonlydata$Volume~moistonlydata$treatment) #not much difference in shrub volume between clipped and unclipped treatments - suggests clipped shrubs do compensate for being clipped and end up as big as shrubs that were not clipped
plot(moistonlydata$Volume~moistonlydata$moist) #Shrub volume seems to increase as soil moisture content increases

#Check model assumptions:

plot(volfitmoistonly2) #linearity seems okay but some variation in residuals in the middle (residuals vs fitted), fit to normality is pretty good (Normal Q-Q), homoscedasiticty assumption does not seem to have a good fit (scale-location), still appear to have an outlier present (residuals vs. leverage)

plot(volfitmoistonlynos32) #imporves linearity assumption a bit but otherwise model is about the same, assumptions wise, as our model with site 3.

##Conclusion: Use model with main effects of site and temperature - best r^2 and adjusted r^2.

##Summary: For shrubs with soil moisture and temperature measures, we must look at models with site and treatment as predictors separately. For the model with treatmment, soil moisture and temperature, none of our predictors show a significant effect on shrub volume. For our model with site,  soil moisture and temperature, we had to again look at effects of predictors separately. We found that the best model includes site and temperature as significant predcitors of shrub volume. However, it is important to keep in mind our small sample size that makes these results difficult to trust.

#Possible predictors: Treatment, site, soil moisture, temperature
#Very low sample size, could not run model with site and treatment together - had to separate

#Fig 1 could be multipanel and include:
#Boxplot of shrub volume by site (moist only and temp and moist? or pick one - look at how similar they are)
#Add fit line to boxplot?
#plot of shrub volume by temperature (temp and moist data)
#Interaction plot of shrub volume by site and treatment (moist only data)
#Interaction plot of shrub volume by site and soil moisture (moist only data)

#Figure 2 could again be multipanel and include:
#Boxplot of temperature by site, potentially treatment as well or a plot by volume
#Example plot for soil moisture - all predictors had a pretty small effect
